eval form:
"5 * X ^ 0 = 5 * X ^ 0"
"4 * X ^ 0 = 8 * X ^ 0"
"5 * X ^ 0 = 4 * X ^ 0 + 7 * X ^ 1"
"5 * X ^ 0 + 13 * X ^ 1 + 3 * X ^ 2 = 1 * X ^ 0 + 1 * X ^ 1"
"6 * X ^ 0 + 11 * X ^ 1 + 5 * X ^ 2 = 1 * X ^ 0 + 1 * X ^ 1"
"5 * X ^ 0 + 3 * X ^ 1 + 3 * X ^ 2 = 1 * X ^ 0 + 0 * X ^ 1"

other tests:
"6 * X ^ 0 + 1 * X ^ 2 = 6 * X ^ 0"

[x] A single coefficient ("4") is considered to be a factor of X ^ 0.
[x] A single X is considered to have a coefficient of 1 and a power of 1. (next cases should fix this)
[x] An absent power ("4 * X") is considered to be 1.
[x] An absent coefficient ("X ^ 6") is considered to be equal to 1.
[x] The powers can be in an arbitrary order, possibly repeated.`

[] fix float at degree.
[] X2 = 0 ==> x = 0
[] 9x2 - 3 = -152 ==> x =  +- (i sqrt(-149))/3
[] (x - 3)2 = 2 => 3 +- sqrt(2)
[] (x + 1)2 = 3 => -1 +- sqrt(3)
